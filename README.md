# Welcome to My Playground!

## ðŸŽ‰ Introduction

Welcome to my little corner of the web, Palmground.
My main goal for this project is to have an place where I can easily try out new stuff without the hassle of setting up a repo or dealing with the codepen editor. And it has the added benefit of being able to share the experiments with others.

The site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).
It uses [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) for code syntax highlighting.
